Information contained here is relevant to my set up. I am providing this to the public in the hopes that it will be useful to others and perhaps improved upon.

The information/configuration gathered here is based on (and was done with the help of) the following three resources:
1. https://github.com/nazar-pc/solax-local-api-docs
2. https://github.com/GitHobi/solax/wiki/direct-data-retrieval
3. https://github.com/squishykid/solax

My electrical configuration is as follows:
1. North America, 240VAC split phase. Two hot legs and neutral from utility transformer (grid). Connected to Grid port in Smartbox.
2. AC coupled Solar (no information yet, as we had snow couple weeks ago that is yet to melt) using Enphase grid forming micro inverters. Connected to Solar port of the Smartbox.
3. Panasonic EVHB-I7 Inverter which appears to be strikingly similar to the Solax A1 Hybrid G2. Connected to ESS1 port of the Smartbox.
4. Panasonic SmartBox (Also Solax?), everything feeds in/from here.
5. ~20kwh battery capacity (4x 5kwh battery modules)
